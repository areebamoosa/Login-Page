# Login Page

This is a simple, static login page created using only **HTML** and **CSS**. I made this project during my early days of learning web development to get hands-on experience with writing HTML elements and applying basic CSS styles to build a functional-looking user interface. It was one of my first steps into the world of frontend development.

### Features

- Clean and minimal login form design.
- Built with pure HTML and CSS.
- No frameworks or responsiveness.
- Focused on practicing basic structure, form elements, and styling.
